# Survey form using React and styling in CSS

Assigment is a simple survey that could be use in trvel agency as a form that customer who wish to get an offer fils and send to the office. 

## The problem
My bigest problem was to understand an idea of props and how to connect everything together. I solved it by attending Technigo's coding sessions, read plainty of different materials about React and how to use forms and inputs in React. I managed to finish my project in the way that I planned with one exeption.  My plan was  to have a submit button after the confirmation, but I could not connect it to the counter. In the end I change that there is the same button used in the whole survay.
